<h2 id="from-cool-to-cult">From Cool to Cult</h2>
<p>The <strong>digital era</strong> is already far from being at its beginning, at the same time as it is far from coming to an end. No matter how long we have been walking, we still have a long path ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Brand new technological innovations</strong> are at every corner, carrying their luggage of new kind of <strong>relationships</strong>, <strong>trends</strong> and <strong>fads</strong>. </p>
<p>It is in this light that most companies try to keep up with the times adopting all these different and ever changing elements of digital to be cooler and cooler and cooler. But coolness is passing and short-lived. </p>
<p>However, <strong>a great design</strong>, which was able to link all the different elements of digital trough a <strong>flexible and adaptable network</strong>, is a <strong>solid millstone</strong> on which the digital transformation of processes or organizations can be built.</p>
<p>This is the reason why we <strong>design</strong> digital environments and their contents: to give your business a new packaging and dig it up <strong>from cool to cult</strong>. </p>
